Summary: My method and some general tips

## Fighting Xenon Shisp

Throughout *ahem* some time in X4 Foundations, I've had a huge variety of success in fighting the Xenon. When I first came to X4 from X3 last year, I mostly avoided
direct confrontation with the Xenon, preferring to try to reinforce NPC fleets in key points. This kind of response only lasts so long in **your** space sandbox where
you want to change anything at will; so I started fighting them. At first I suffered heavy losses, especially in sector, against any Xenon capital fleet or sufficiently
big cloud of P. It took a while before I learned the trick to fighting the Xenon's ships: overwhelming them with numbers. If the Xenon bring three capitals to the fight,
you should have at least ten to counter them. If they bring a few dozen M and N, you should have at least 50 high-survivability fighters. The effect is especially 
important in-sector, where combat with Xenon capitals results in higher losses than out-of-sector combat. My typical fleet size is overprovisioned to account for this;
the more ships you have, the better their collective chances of survival and the less micromanaging you need to do in equipping replacement fleets.

If you're just starting out and don't have the resources to field a fleet, you can still handle Xenon capitals one-on-one in a M-sized ship (usually a corvette) if you have
the right equipment. Prioritize high average damage output guns on a maneuverable ship like a Katana, Dragon, or Kuraokami- bonus points if your chosen gun ignores shields.
If you have access to Split weapons, the Thermal Disintegrators are great for this purpose. You want to be able to swoop in behind the capital ship where both K and I have
a (relatively) blind spot. Both ships have a battery of M-sized turrets protecting their aft but no L-sized turrets pointing directly backward. If you can get in close
and take out those guns, you have bought yourself a safe place to recharge your shields while steadily taking the rest of the machine apart. Start with the engines so
the ship doesn't move far, then move on to taking out the graviton turrets and shield generators. If you're in a patrolled sector, it's likely the NPCs will join in to
help.

While you can handle a single capital, a group of capitals is a harder challenge in an M-class ship. For that purpose I'd recommend a Rattlesnake or Syn destroyer; both
have enough damage output to take out a Xenon capital before you get too crispy.

### Fleet Composition

Here's an example of a single anti-Xenon fleet:

```
Fleet Name: 45 Ulexite
Fleet Leader: Tokyo
Support Ship: Honshu (with four Katana escorts)
Battleships (10): Syn with L Bolt and M Bolt turrets
Fighters (50): Kalis with maximum shielding and Mk2 Proton Barrage
```

This is sufficient to handle any group of Xenon warships that doesn't exceed 3 capital ships OOS. For gate defense, I'll usually put two of these on "Defend Position"
around the gate; I have very occasional destroyer losses using this deployment.
