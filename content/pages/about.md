Hey I'm Jamie Luck. I'm a human bean from the United States who uses computers professionally and for fun. I'm a dedicated Linux user, vim nerd, and student of large-scale computer systems. While designing computers and the interfaces for them, I like to think about the ways in which computers and culture interact. Historically and currently, the influence of computers on culture is something that should be written about, so I'm endeavoring to do so.
